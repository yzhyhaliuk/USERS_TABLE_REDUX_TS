Hi there!

This is my implementation of a user table with filters for all columns, built as part of a frontend challenge.

I used React with Redux Toolkit and TypeScript to keep the code clean, type-safe, and modern. Styling is done with SCSS modules to keep things organized and responsive.

I spent some extra time on custom empty state handling and input validation to make sure users don’t see empty rows and get helpful feedback if they type only spaces.

One thing that took the most time was getting the typings right. It was definitely a good investment — clean, error-free code matters a lot! Redux Toolkit made managing state much easier, but planning types carefully was key.

The design is fully responsive — it looks good and works smoothly on phones, tablets, and desktops alike.

Feel free to explore the code, and I’d be happy to hear any feedback!
